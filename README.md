# Hugo Mock Landing Page (Autodeployed)

This repository is an automated deployment version of my Hugo-based landing page.  
It uses GitHub Actions to build the site and deploy it to GitHub Pages every time I push to the `main` branch.

## 🔁 CI/CD Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yaml`.  
It performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository
2. Initializes the Hugo environment (v0.144.1)
3. Builds the static website with `hugo -D --gc --minify`
4. Publishes the `public/` output to the `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`

## 🌐 Deployment URL

The website is live at:  
[https://johnkala.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/](https://johnkala.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/)

## 🧠 Claude YAML Explanation

See [`github-actions-workflow-explanation.pdf`](github-actions-workflow-explanation.pdf)  
for a line-by-line walkthrough of the GitHub Actions configuration, using Anthropic’s Claude AI.

## 🛠️ GitHub Pages Setup

- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch
- Repository permissions allow GitHub Actions to write and trigger workflows

## 🧪 Live Reload

Every push to `main` triggers a new deployment.  
For example, changing `content/contact.md` immediately updates the live site via GitHub Actions.
